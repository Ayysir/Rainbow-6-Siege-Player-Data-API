# Rainbow 6 Siege Player Data API
A simple API that gets player's data from R6Tab's API and filters it to human readable data. Can be used with Nightbot.

#Description
I wrote a PHP API that uses the R6Tab.com's API to get data from a player (for now, this API is able to get the player's rank and mmr from a specific region and plataform). I made this so a streamer can add a command in Nightbot to show is rank and mmr in R6S.
